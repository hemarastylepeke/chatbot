It includes the study of management, psychology, communication, economics and sociology.\\nIt involves team spirit and team work.\\nIt is a continuous process.\\n\\n \\nHuman resource management as a department in an organisation handles all aspects of employees and has various functions like  human resource planning, Conducting Job analysis, recruitment and conducting job interviews, selection of human resources, Orienting , training, compensating,Providing benefits and incentives, appraising, retaining,Career planning, Quality of Work Life, Employee Discipline,  black out Sexual Harassments, human resource auditing, maintenance of industrial relationship, looking after welfare of employees and safety issues , communicating with all employees at all levels and maintaining awareness of and compliance with local, state and federal labor laws.\\n\\nThe historical rule of thumb for Human Resource staffing requirements is one full-time professional Human Resource person should be hired for every 100 employees. The actual ratio for a business can vary depending upon factors such as the degree of HR centralization, the geographic distribution of the employees served, the sophistication level of the employees, and the relative complexity of the organization.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the importance of Human resource?\\n\\nBehind production of every product or service there is an human mind, effort and man hours (working hours). No product or service can be produced without help of human being. Human being is fundamental resource for making or construction of anything. Every organisation desire is to have skilled and competent people to make their organisation competent and best.\\n\\nAmong the five Ms of management, i.e., men, money, machines, materials, and methods, HRM deals about the first M, which is men. It is believed that in the five Ms, \"men\" is  not so easy to manage. \"every man is different from other\" and they are totally different from the other Ms in the sense that men possess the power to manipulate the other Ms. Whereas, the other Ms are either lifeless or abstract and as such, do not have the power to think and decide what is good for them.\\n\\n\\nWhy do we call it as Human Resource Management?\\n\\nHuman: refers to the skilled workforce in an organization.\\nResource: refers to limited availability or scarce.\\nManagement: refers  how to optimize  and make best use of such limited or scarce resource so as to meet the organization goals and objectives.\\n\\nTherefore, human resource management is meant for proper utilisation of  available skilled workforce and also to make efficient use of existing human resource in the organisation. The best example in present situation is, construction industry has been facing serious shortage of skilled workforce. It is  expected to triple in the next decade from the present 30 per cent, will negatively impact the overall productivity of the sector, warn industry experts.\\n\\nToday many experts claim that machines and technology are replacing human resource and minimizing their role or effort. However, machines and technology are built by the humans only and they need to be operated or at least monitored by humans and this is the reason why companies are always in hunt  for talented, skilled and qualified professionals for continuous development of the organization.\\n\\nTherefore humans are crucial assets for any organisation, although today many tasks have been handing over to the artificial intelligence but they lack judgement skills which cannot be matched with human mind.\\n\\nEvolution of an employee\\n\\n Past    \\t Future\\n Work 9 to 5    \\n Work anytime\\n Work in an office\\n Work anywhere and from anywhere\\n Use company equipment\\n Use your own modern gadgets and requirements\\n Focused on inputs\\n  Focused on outputs\\n Climb the corporate ladder\\n Create your own ladder for career\\n Pre-defined work\\n Customized work\\n Hoards information          \\n Shares information\\n No voice\\n Can become a leader\\n Focused on knowledge\\n Focused on adaptive learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining\"\\n-British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking\\n\\nIt is undisputed fact that humans are being replaced by artificial intelligence which are in the form of robots. But all jobs cannot be handed over to Robots, to say in other words robots have its own limitations and all roles cannot be handled by robots.Though  British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking,Cambridge professor expressed about destruction of middle-class jobs due to raise of artificial intelligence,he still felt that natural intelligence or need for application of human mind is inevitable in certain roles.\\n\\nGreat Quotations on human resource\\n\\n\"You must treat your employees with respect and dignity because in the most automated factory in the world, you need the power of human mind. That is what brings in innovation. If you want high quality minds to work for you, then you must protect the respect and dignity. \" ---Mr N.R. Narayana Murthy, Chairman Emeritus, Infosys Ltd .\\n\\nâ€œOur progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. The human mind is our fundamental resource.â€\\n- John F. Kennedy (35th President of the United States).\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Resource Management Definitions by Authors\\n\\n\\n\\nMany great scholars had defined human resource management in different ways and with different words, but the core meaning of the human resource management deals with how to manage people or employees in the organisation.\\n\\nEdwin Flippo defines- Human Resource Management as â€œplanning, organizing, directing, controlling of procurement, development, compensation, integration , maintenance and separation of human resources to the end that individual, organizational and social objectives are achieved.â€\\n\\nThe National Institute of Personal Management (NIPM) of India has defined human resources â€“ personal management as â€œthat part of management which is concerned with people at work and with their relationship within an enterprise. Its aim is to bring together and develop into an effective organization of the men and women who make up enterprise and having regard for the well â€“ being of the individuals and of working groups, to enable them to make their best contribution to its successâ€.\\n\\nAccording to Decenzo and Robbins, â€œHuman Resource Management is concerned with the people dimensionâ€ in management. Since every organization is made up of people, acquiring their services, developing their skills, motivating them to higher levels of performance and ensuring that they continue to maintain their commitment to the organization is essential to achieve organsational objectives. This is true, regardless of the type of organization â€“ government, business, education, health or social actionâ€.\\n\\n\\nEvolution of Human resource management\\n\\n\\nHuman resource management is evolved form the Personnel management which was erstwhile management system which used to manage employees. To know evolution of personnel management one needs to see the history of centuries of research by great psychologists on human human behaviour and their response at particular situations. One among them was Elton Mayo who was a psychologists from the Australia, did many experiments on human behaviour at different situations in 1924. He  strongly believed in work life balance for improving productivity of workers and did emphasis on human relations influence the productivity of workers and finally he has been regarded as father of Human resources management.\\n\\nGoing back to roots of evolution Personnel management , Robert Owen was regarded as creator and originator for introducing reforms for workers in his own Lanark cotton mills. He created a principle of 8 hours day work, 8 hours rest and 8 hours sleep. Owen identified the importance of better working conditions at workplace and its impact on the productivity and efficiency of the workers. Owen after implementation of better working conditions at workplace, he observed change in the productivity of his workers as their efficiency increased. He in those  olden days implemented many social and welfare practices for his workers and saw his workers got happy, motivated and worked better. Therefore he was referred as father of Personnel management.\\nIt\\'s believed that the first personnel management department (later evolved as Human resource management) began at the National Cash Register Co. in the early 1900s, according to an Human Resource Magazine article. After several strikes and employee lockouts, NCR leader John H. Patterson organized a personnel department to handle grievances, discharges, and safety, as well as training for supervisors on new laws and practices.\\nHistorical Milestones In Hrm Development >>\\nThe Historical Background Of Human Resource Management >>\\nFather of Personnel Management >>\\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the world\\'s largest HR department. OPM provides Human Resource services for the federal governments workforce of nearly 2.8 million workers. It\\'s staff carry out the tasks to recruit, interview, and promote employees; oversee merit pay, benefits and retirement programs; and ensure that all employees and applicants are treated fairly and according to the law.\\n\\n\\nFather of Personnel Management\\n\\nRobert Owen >> \\n(14 May 1771 â€“ 17 November 1858)\\nRobert Owen raised the demand for  ten-hour day in year 1810, and instituted it in his New Lanark cotton mills. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the 8-hour day and coined  slogan 8 hours labour, 8 hours recreation, 8 hours full rest.\\n\\nWomen and children in the England were granted the ten-hour day in 1847. The  8-hour day movement forms part of the early history for the celebration of the Labour Day, and the May Day in many nations and cultures.\\n\\n\\nFather of Human resource management\\n\\nGeorge Elton Mayo\\n(26 December 1880 â€“ 7 September 1949)\\nWhat is the purpose of Human resource management?\\n\\nThe purpose of the Human resource management is to make the job and deal with the job holder (employee). So as to perform a job in an organisation, one needs to be identified. In order to identify right person for a particular job, notification should be issued which contains job description ( duties and responsibilities) and specifications ( academic qualifications and physical qualifications). So as to verify the correctness of the candidates invited, they should be tested by the suitable selection methods for picking-up right person. Subsequently selected candidates should be provided with the proper training for performing his duties & responsibilities mentioned in the notification. Later, assessment of employees\\' performance should be done to know whether employees are performing to the desired standards set by the management. Accordingly employees should be rewarded or paid for the job they did in the organisation and their safety in the job is the responsibility of Hr manager or safety officer who should instruct safety measures for the employees and see that they are scrupulously followed. Healthy and welfare measures are so-so important to keep employees happy and motivated which has direct impact on their productivity. Doing so all, maintaining proper and healthy relationships between employees and management  avoids conflicts which will effect the overall performance of the organisation. Most important thing is adherence and not to ignore employment and labour laws which govern all the above said activities for a job. Contravenes  of employment laws will cost to the organisation and its branding. Hence the Human resource management is like a guardian angel for the organisation to sail smoothly and long-live.\\n\\nThe ten \"Cs\" of human resources management are: cost effectiveness, competitive, coherence, credibility, communication, creativity, competitive advantage, competence, change, and commitment. The ten \"Cs\" framework was developed by Alan Price in his book \"Human Resource Management in a Business Context\".\\n\\n\\nWhy Is Human Resource Management Important to All Managers?\\n\\nWhy are these concepts and techniques important to all managers? \\' Perhaps it\\'s easier to answer this by listing some of the personnel mistakes you don\\'t want to make while manÂ\\xadaging. For example, you don\\'t want to:\\nHire the wrong person for the job.\\nExperience high turnover\\nHave your people not doing their best\\nWaste time with useless interviews\\nHave your company taken to court because of discriminatory actions\\nHave your company cited under federal occupational safety laws for unsafe practices\\nHave some employees think their salaries are unfair and inequitable relative to others in the organization\\nAllow a lack of training to undermine your department\\'s effectiveness\\nCommit any unfair labor practices\\n\\nDifference between Personnel management and Human resource management.\\n\\nComing to the crux of difference, Personnel management is the seed and root for Human resources management. To say in simple words Human resource management is evolved from the Personnel management. Main principle of the Personnel management was to extract work from an employee for the remuneration paid. Employees during the Personnel management era were not given high priority in decision making process and weren\\'t much allowed to interact with management. Personnel management was more confined to the factories and the main focus of the Personal manager was to see that everything was in compliance with the labour laws or not but not much emphasis made on the morale of employees. Employees were just treated as tools, obligation to the organisation but not as the asset of the organisation, besides they were seen as  cost & expenditure to company rather than capital and investment. Personnel officers mostly used be disciplinary oriented instead of flexible and interactive with employees. Nurturing  of employees was not priority by the personnel managers and employees perspective was ignored which means personnel managers rather than understanding situation they used to be punitive if any error was committed by employee.\\n\\nHuman resource management see employees from the perspective as a most valuable resources for the organisation and they consider their employees as assets and capital for their organisation. Motivating employees is a basic feature of human resource management in contrast with personal management. Main principle of the Human resource management is to see what should be given to an employee for extracting the desired work. Hr Managers always encourage participation of employees in decision making and their suggestions are most valued. Flexibility in work, welfare and Work life balance to employees is high priority for Hr managers and they show much more concern towards employee issues. Adoption of new policies and optimisation methods by the Hr manager are well encouraged and swift. The finest difference between Personnel management and Human resource management is integration and augmentation of Information Technologies in the human resources management process and functions for enhanced productivity and time savings as time is money.

Parliament has enacted the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, to implement article 39(d). The act provides for payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for the same work, or work of a similar nature and for the prevention of discrimination on grounds of sex.

The very fact that the parties reserve the ultimate right to use economic weapons of strike and lock out helps in stimulating the parties to arrive at an agreement.\\nThe Encyclopedia Americana states that the American Federation of labour â€œinsists upon the equity of workers in their right to bargain collectively with employers through representatives of their own choosingâ€.\\n\\nBeing a spokesman of employees and organization: It is the responsibility of human resource manager to be as, spokesman,  negotiator and middlemen between management and employees for smoothening the flow of communication of management decisions from top-level to bottom level and vice versa, for cushioning conflicts if any by misunderstandings or misinterpretation and to establish healthy relations and good culture within the organisation. In sometimes HR manager should take the responsibility of a spokesman of organization when representing or dealing with other stakeholders.\\nResolving conflicts among employees is major task of human Resource Management. Hr manager could follow the below steps for resolving conflicts. According to recent study human resource managers are spending considerable amount of their job time on resolving conflicts in between employees as diversity in conflicts are in raise and showing impact on performance of employees and on organization.\\nUnderstanding the cause, root and nature of the conflict.\\nEncourage employees to solve conflicts themselves.\\nDo not widen or magnify conflicts, Nip it in the bud quickly.\\nGive an opportunity to both sides to say and listen to them\\nDetermine the real cause of issue, together.\\nCheck your employee handbook for solution and guidance.\\nCome to a solution.\\nPut it on paper for make them binding and for future reference in such cases.\\nTrain them how to communicate and avoid conflicts\\nHR manager should be an idealistic and set an example himself.\\nPrevention and dealing with sexual harassment: is crucial duty of Human Resource Management, otherwise it may effect the organisation\\'s culture and employer branding which would consequently lead to collapse of the organization. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 protects women at the workplace from sexual harassment. Act defines sexual harassment at the work place and creates a mechanism for redressal of complaints. It also provides safeguards against false or malicious charges. Every employer is required to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee at each office or branch with 10 or more employees. Any employer who fails to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee as per the Sexual Harassment Act shall be liable for a penalty of up to Rs. 50,000 if a complaint is made to the magistrate.\\nAny woman employee who has faced sexual harassment at the workplace, or any person authorized by the Internal or Local Complaints Committee can file a complaint with the Magistrate. Repeated non-compliance of this provision can result in the punishment being doubled or even cancellation of the organisation\\'s business license by the concern government or local authority.\\n\\n The Indian Penal Code 1860 Section 354A, 354B,354C, 354D was newly inserted, especially for the following acts which shall be treated as sexual harassment.\\nPhysical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures; or\\ndemand request for sexual favours; or\\nshowing pornography again as the will of a woman; or\\nmaking sexually coloured remarks on women.\\nany man who assaults or uses criminal force to any women or abets such act with the intention of disrobing (taking off oneâ€™s clothes) are compelling her to be naked -section 354B\\'\\nAny man who watches captures images of women engaging in a private act in circumstances where she would usually have the exception are not being observed either by the perpetrator or by any other person. - section 354C\\nFollowing a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such women repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such women.- section 354D\\nPunishment\\nFor the above said offences the punishment shall be for a period of one to three years of imprisonment or fine, or both\\n\\n\\nObjectives of Human Resource Management\\n\\nSocietal objective.To be socially responsible to the needs and challenges of society while minimizing the negative impact of such demands upon the organization. The failure of organizations to use their resources for society\\'s benefit may result in restrictions. For example, societies may pass laws that limit human resource decisions.\\n\\nâ€œThe greatest tragedy in America is not the destruction of our natural resources, though that tragedy is great. The truly great tragedy is the destruction of our human resources by our failure to fully utilize our abilities, which means that most men and women go to their graves with their music still in them.â€ - Oliver Wendell Holmes.\\n\\n \\n\\nOrganizational objective. To recognize that Human resource management exists to contribute to organizational effectiveness. HRM is not an end in itself; it is only a means to assist the organization with its primary objectives. Simply stated, the department exists to serve the rest of the organization.\\n\\n\"I emphasize this - no matter how good or successful you are or how clever or crafty, your business and its future are in the hands of the people you hire\".  --- Akio Morita (Late) (Businessman and co-founder of Sony Corporation. Japan) Ref: The Book : MADE IN JAPAN. Page.No.145\\n\\nFunctional objective.To maintain the department\\'s contribution at a level appropriate to the organisation\\'s needs. Resources are wasted when Human Resource Management is more or less sophisticated than the organisation demands. A department\\'s level of service must be appropriate for the organisation it serves. \\n\\nPersonal objective. To assist employees in achieving their personal goals, at least insofar as these goals enhance the individual\\'s contribution to the organisation. Personal objectives of employees must be met if workers are to be maintained, retained and motivated. Otherwise, employee performance and satisfaction may decline, and employees may leave the organisation.\\n\\n\\nSpecialists analytics in high demand for HR roles: Study\\nET Bureau\\nMay 14, 2018\\n\\n\\nIndia has seen 77% growth in specialized analytics professionals employed in human resource functions in the past five years, as an increasing number of companies are turning to analytics to address workforce planning, skills gap and employee retention, according to a study by professional network LinkedIn.\\n\\nâ€œThe overall business landscape and the changing role of Human Resource as a more strategic partner in business are driving the rise of analytics in HR.

recruiting, selecting, inducting employees, providing orientation, imparting training and development, appraising the performance of employees, deciding compensation and providing benefits, motivating employees, maintaining proper relations with employees and their trade unions, ensuring employees safety, welfare and healthy measures in compliance with labour laws of the land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhuman resource management involves management functions like planning, organizing, directing and controlling\\nit involves procurement, development, maintenance of human resource\\nit helps to achieve individual, organizational and social objectives\\nhuman resource management is a multidisciplinary subject. it includes the study of management, psychology, communication, economics and sociology.\\nit involves team spirit and team work.\\nit is a continuous process.\\n\\n \\nhuman resource management as a department in an organisation handles all aspects of employees and has various functions like  human resource planning, conducting job analysis, recruitment and conducting job interviews, selection of human resources, orienting , training, compensating,providing benefits and incentives, appraising, retaining,career planning, quality of work life, employee discipline,  black out sexual harassments, human resource auditing, maintenance of industrial relationship, looking after welfare of employees and safety issues , communicating with all employees at all levels and maintaining awareness of and compliance with local, state and federal labor laws.\\n\\nthe historical rule of thumb for human resource staffing requirements is one full-time professional human resource person should be hired for every 100 employees. the actual ratio for a business can vary depending upon factors such as the degree of hr centralization, the geographic distribution of the employees served, the sophistication level of the employees, and the relative complexity of the organization.\\n\\n\\nwhat is the importance of human resource?\\n\\nbehind production of every product or service there is an human mind, effort and man hours (working hours). no product or service can be produced without help of human being. human being is fundamental resource for making or construction of anything. every organisation desire is to have skilled and competent people to make their organisation competent and best.\\n\\namong the five ms of management, i.e., men, money, machines, materials, and methods, hrm deals about the first m, which is men. it is believed that in the five ms, \"men\" is  not so easy to manage. \"every man is different from other\" and they are totally different from the other ms in the sense that men possess the power to manipulate the other ms. whereas, the other ms are either lifeless or abstract and as such, do not have the power to think and decide what is good for them.\\n\\n\\nwhy do we call it as human resource management?\\n\\nhuman: refers to the skilled workforce in an organization.\\nresource: refers to limited availability or scarce.\\nmanagement: refers  how to optimize  and make best use of such limited or scarce resource so as to meet the organization goals and objectives.\\n\\ntherefore, human resource management is meant for proper utilisation of  available skilled workforce and also to make efficient use of existing human resource in the organisation. the best example in present situation is, construction industry has been facing serious shortage of skilled workforce. it is  expected to triple in the next decade from the present 30 per cent, will negatively impact the overall productivity of the sector, warn industry experts.\\n\\ntoday many experts claim that machines and technology are replacing human resource and minimizing their role or effort. however, machines and technology are built by the humans only and they need to be operated or at least monitored by humans and this is the reason why companies are always in hunt  for talented, skilled and qualified professionals for continuous development of the organization.\\n\\ntherefore humans are crucial assets for any organisation, although today many tasks have been handing over to the artificial intelligence but they lack judgement skills which cannot be matched with human mind.\\n\\nevolution of

manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining\"\\n-british theoretical physicist stephen hawking\\n\\nit is undisputed fact that humans are being replaced by artificial intelligence which are in the form of robots. but all jobs cannot be handed over to robots, to say in other words robots have its own limitations and all roles cannot be handled by robots.though  british theoretical physicist stephen hawking,cambridge professor expressed about destruction of middle-class jobs due to raise of artificial intelligence,he still felt that natural intelligence or need for application of human mind is inevitable in certain roles.\\n\\ngreat quotations on human resource\\n\\n\"you must treat your employees with respect and dignity because in the most automated factory in the world, you need the power of human mind. that is what brings in innovation. if you want high quality minds to work for you, then you must protect the respect and dignity. \" ---mr n.r. narayana murthy, chairman emeritus, infosys ltd .\\n\\nâ€œour progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. the human mind is our fundamental resource.â€\\n- john f. kennedy (35th president of the united states).\\n\\n\\n\\nhuman resource management definitions by authors\\n\\n\\n\\nmany great scholars had defined human resource management in different ways and with different words, but the core meaning of the human resource management deals with how to manage people or employees in the organisation.\\n\\nedwin flippo defines- human resource management as â€œplanning, organizing, directing, controlling of procurement, development, compensation, integration , maintenance and separation of human resources to the end that individual, organizational and social objectives are achieved.â€\\n\\nthe national institute of personal management (nipm) of india has defined human resources â€“ personal management as â€œthat part of management which is concerned with people at work and with their relationship within an enterprise. its aim is to bring together and develop into an effective organization of the men and women who make up enterprise and having regard for the well â€“ being of the individuals and of working groups, to enable them to make their best contribution to its successâ€.\\n\\naccording to decenzo and robbins, â€œhuman resource management is concerned with the people dimensionâ€ in management. since every organization is made up of people, acquiring their services, developing their skills, motivating them to higher levels of performance and ensuring that they continue to maintain their commitment to the organization is essential to achieve organsational objectives. this is true, regardless of the type of organization â€“ government, business, education, health or social actionâ€.\\n\\n\\nevolution of human resource management\\n\\n\\nhuman resource management is evolved form the personnel management which was erstwhile management system which used to manage employees. to know evolution of personnel management one needs to see the history of centuries of research by great psychologists on human human behaviour and their response at particular situations. one among them was elton mayo who was a psychologists from the australia, did many experiments on human behaviour at different situations in 1924. he  strongly believed in work life balance for improving productivity of workers and did emphasis on human relations influence the productivity of workers and finally he has been regarded as father of human resources management.\\n\\ngoing back to roots of evolution personnel management , robert owen was regarded as creator and originator for introducing reforms for workers in his own lanark cotton mills. he created a principle of 8 hours day work, 8 hours rest and 8 hours sleep. owen identified the importance of better working conditions at workplace and its impact on the productivity and efficiency of the workers. owen after implementation of better working conditions at workplace, he observed change in the productivity of his workers as their efficiency increased. he in those  olden days implemented many social and welfare practices for his workers and saw his workers got happy, motivated and worked better. therefore he was referred as father of personnel management.\\nit\\'s believed that the first personnel management department (later evolved as human resource management) began at the national cash register co. in the early 1900s, according to an human resource magazine article. after several strikes and employee lockouts, ncr leader john h. patterson organized a personnel department to handle grievances, discharges, and safety, as well as training for supervisors on new laws and practices.\\nhistorical milestones in hrm development >>\\nthe historical background of human resource management >>\\nfather of personnel management >>\\nthe u.s. office of personnel management (opm) is the world\\'s largest hr department. opm provides human resource services for the federal governments workforce of nearly 2.8 million workers. it\\'s staff carry out the tasks to recruit, interview, and promote employees; oversee merit pay, benefits and retirement programs; and ensure that all employees and applicants are treated fairly and according to the law.\\n\\n\\nfather of personnel management\\n\\nrobert owen >> \\n(14 may 1771 â€“ 17 november 1858)\\nrobert owen raised the demand for  ten-hour day in year 1810, and instituted it in his new lanark cotton mills. by 1817 he had formulated the goal of the 8-hour day and coined  slogan 8 hours labour, 8 hours recreation, 8 hours full rest.\\n\\nwomen and children in the england were granted the ten-hour day in 1847. the  8-hour day movement forms part of the early history for the celebration of the labour day, and the may day in many nations and cultures.\\n\\n\\nfather of human resource management\\n\\ngeorge elton mayo\\n(26 december 1880 â€“ 7 september 1949)\\nwhat is the purpose of human resource management?\\n\\nthe purpose of the human resource management is to make the job and deal with the job holder (employee). so as to perform a job in an organisation, one needs to be identified. in order to identify right person for a particular job, notification should be issued which contains job description ( duties and responsibilities) and specifications ( academic qualifications and physical qualifications). so as to verify the correctness of the candidates invited, they should be tested by the suitable selection methods for picking-up right person. subsequently selected candidates should be provided with the proper training for performing his duties & responsibilities mentioned in the notification. later, assessment of employees\\' performance should be done to know whether employees are performing to the desired standards set by the management. accordingly employees should be rewarded or paid for the job they did in the organisation and their safety in the job is the responsibility of hr manager or safety officer who should instruct safety measures for the employees and see that they are scrupulously followed. healthy and welfare measures are so-so important to keep employees happy and motivated which has direct impact on their productivity. doing so all, maintaining proper and healthy relationships between employees and management  avoids conflicts which will effect the overall performance of the organisation. most important thing is adherence and not to ignore employment and labour laws which govern all the above said activities for a job. contravenes  of employment laws will cost to the organisation and its branding. hence the human resource management is like a guardian angel for the organisation to sail smoothly and long-live.\\n\\nthe ten \"cs\" of human resources management are: cost effectiveness, competitive, coherence, credibility, communication, creativity, competitive advantage, competence, change, and commitment. the ten \"cs\" framework was developed by alan price in his book \"human resource management in a business context\".\\n\\n\\nwhy is human resource management important to all managers?\\n\\nwhy are these concepts and techniques important to all managers? \\' perhaps it\\'s easier to answer this by listing some of the personnel mistakes you don\\'t want to make while manâ\\xadaging. for example, you don\\'t want to:\\nhire the wrong person for the job.\\nexperience high turnover\\nhave your people not doing their best\\nwaste time with useless interviews\\nhave your company taken to court because of discriminatory actions\\nhave your company cited under federal occupational safety laws for unsafe practices\\nhave some employees think their salaries are unfair and inequitable relative to others in the organization\\nallow a lack of training to undermine your department\\'s effectiveness\\ncommit any unfair labor practices\\n\\ndifference between personnel management and human resource management.\\n\\ncoming to the crux of difference, personnel management is the seed and root for human resources management. to say in simple words human resource management is evolved from the personnel management. main principle of the personnel management was to extract work from an employee for the remuneration paid. employees during the personnel management era were not given high priority in decision making process and weren\\'t much allowed to interact with management. personnel management was more confined to the factories and the main focus of the personal manager was to see that everything was in compliance with the labour laws or not but not much emphasis made on the morale of employees. employees were just treated as tools, obligation to the organisation but not as the asset of the organisation, besides they were seen as  cost & expenditure to company rather than capital and investment. personnel officers mostly used be disciplinary oriented instead of flexible and interactive with employees. nurturing  of employees was not priority by the personnel managers and employees perspective was ignored which means personnel managers rather than understanding situation they used to be punitive if any error was committed by employee.\\n\\nhuman resource management see employees from the perspective as a most valuable resources for the organisation and they consider their employees as assets and capital for their organisation. motivating employees is a basic feature of human resource management in contrast with personal management. main principle of the human resource management is to see what should be given to an employee for extracting the desired work. hr managers always encourage participation of employees in decision making and their suggestions are most valued. flexibility in work, welfare and work life balance to employees is high priority for hr managers and they show much more concern towards employee issues. adoption of new policies and optimisation methods by the hr manager are well encouraged and swift. the finest difference between personnel management and human resource management is integration and augmentation of information technologies in the human resources management process and functions for enhanced productivity and time savings as time is money. all above artificial intelligence and roberts are taking over many hr functions ranging from employees recruitment, testing, interviewing and many more.\\n\\n\\nwho is responsible for human resource management?\\n\\nhuman resource officer or manager is responsible for human resource management in the organization.\\n\\nthe hr director is a
